wsj_0632.out| General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of Jaguar PLC,|" as GM got early clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to boost its stake in the British luxury car maker. GM confirmed Friday that it received permission late Thursday from U.S. antitrust regulators to increase its Jaguar holdings past the $15 million level. Ford got a similar go-ahead earlier in October, and on Friday, Jaguar announced that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker had raised its stake to 13.2%, or 24.2 million shares, from 12.4% earlier in the week. A spokesman for GM, the No. 1 auto maker, declined to say how many Jaguar shares that company owns. In late trading Friday, Jaguar shares bucked the downward tide in London's stock market and rose five pence to 725 pence ($11.44 Trading volume was a moderately heavy 3.1 million shares. In the U.S., Jaguar's American depositary receipts were among the most active issues Friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $11.625 each, up 62.5 cents. Analysts expect that the two U.S. auto giants will move quickly to buy up 15% stakes in Jaguar, setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious Jaguar brand. British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15% before the end of 1990 without government permission. The British government, which owned Jaguar until 1984, still holds a controlling ""golden share"" in the company. With the golden share as protection, Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford's overtures, and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM. Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar's independence, but no deal has been announced. Ford, on the other hand, has said it's willing to bid for all of Jaguar, despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan. Analysts continued to speculate late last week that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990. But a Ford spokeswoman in Dearborn said Friday the company hasn't requested such a meeting yet. Individuals close to the situation believe Ford officials will seek a meeting this week with Sir John to outline their proposal for a full bid. Any discussions with Ford could postpone the Jaguar-GM deal, headed for completion within the next two weeks. The GM agreement is expected to retain Jaguar's independence by involving an eventual 30% stake for the U.S. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures. Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that wouldn't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires. ""There's either a minority {stake} package capable of getting Jaguar shareholder approval or there isn't,"" said one knowledgeable individual. ""If there isn't, {the deal} won't be put forward"" to shareholders. Union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a Jaguar-GM accord. GM's U.K. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an Ellesmere Port site for its first major engine plant in Britain. One auto-industry union leader said, ""If they try to build it somewhere else {in Europe} besides the U.K., they are going to be in big trouble"" with unionists over any Jaguar deal."|evidence|explanation|0

wsj_1307.out| In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining|" that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them. David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination. With due respect to ""highly classified correspondence"" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service. If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know. What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry. Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping ""top secret"" on their own complicity. But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too. The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega. When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads. The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity. But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress? For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations? What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops? Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol. Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you. Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: Confiding in the United States may be fatal. CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup. The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. ""The interpretation"" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, ""and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me."" In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA. The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter. And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties. Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North. The Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Senator William Cohen, joined with Senator George Mitchell to write a best seller about Iran-Contra, deploring ""Men of Zeal."" No doubt many people in the CIA, the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read it. What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail? Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play? The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action. President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security. There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars. The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed. In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility. The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral. As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't ""assassinate"" Colonel Gadhafi. It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal. Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him."|List|joint|69
wsj_1307.out| In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining|" that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them. David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination. With due respect to ""highly classified correspondence"" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service. If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know. What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry. Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping ""top secret"" on their own complicity. But there's no danger of exposing sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. And if Congress is going to assume authority to micromanage foreign policy, it's going to have to take some of the responsibility too. The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega. When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads. The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity. But what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by Congress? For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations? What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops? Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol. Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you. Or maybe a Surgeon General's warning: Confiding in the United States may be fatal. CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup. The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. ""The interpretation"" of the executive order, Mr. Stoltz said, ""and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me."" In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA. The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter."|explanation-argumentative|explanation|70

wsj_1126.out| Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced|" that they and two Soviet partners will construct two ""world-class"" hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow. U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations. ""This is an outstanding example of how the East and the West can work together for their mutual benefit and progress,"" said Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin, who hosted a signing ceremony for the venture's partners at the Soviet embassy here. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a ""historic step"" in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties. He added that it likely will have a ""mulitiplier effect"" in stimulating further trade between the two countries. The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years. One of the hotels, to be called the Sheraton Moscow, will have 450 rooms and will cost an estimated $75 million to build. The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers. It will have a Russian tavern, an English pub, a discotheque and Japanese and Italian restaurants, according to a Sheraton announcement. The hotel is scheduled to open in 1992. The second hotel, to be called the Budapest Hotel, is to be constructed at a site even closer to Red Square. Details about its size and cost haven't yet been determined. Sheraton, a subsidiary of ITT Corp., will have a 40% share in the two hotels; Pan American, a subsidiary of Pan Am Corp., will have a 10% share. The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline. Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel, the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50% foreign ownership. U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987. But some U.S. companies are negotiating projects that could be among the biggest ones to be launched. Chevron Corp., Amoco Corp., Archer-Daniels-Midla- nd Co., and Eastman Kodak Co. are among the U.S. companies known to be considering such ventures. Sheraton and Pan Am said they are assured under the Soviet joint-venture law that they can repatriate profits from their hotel venture. The Sheraton Moscow will charge about $140 to $150 a day for each of its rooms, and it will accept payment only in currencies that can be traded in foreign exchange markets, according to a Sheraton executive. Thomas Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said the U.S. airline's participation is a natural outgrowth of its current arrangements with Aeroflot to jointly operate nonstop New York-Moscow flights. He said the rising volume of passenger traffic on this route justifies a major investment in new high-standard Moscow hotels."|background|background|161

wsj_2386.out| Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend,|" but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market. ""I'm not losing faith in the market,"" said Boston lawyer Christopher Sullivan as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm. But he's not so sure about everyone else. ""I think on Monday the small (investors predicted Mr. Sullivan, whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds. ""And I think institutions are going to come in and buy . . . I'm going to hold on. If I sell now, I'll take a big loss."" Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they didn't flee the market in 1987. ""Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday,"" said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky. Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, ""but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more."" At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm. Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday. But Robert Showalter, an official of the association, said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors' clubs are planned. In fact, some of the association's members -- long-term, buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices. ""We hope to take advantage of it,"" said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club. He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants. Not everyone is reacting so calmly, however, and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday's slide, reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines. Marc Perkins, a Tampa, Fla., investment banker, said the market drop is one of ""a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending. There's no question that there's a general distaste for leverage among lenders."" Mr. Perkins believes, however, that the market could be stabilized if California investor Marvin Davis steps back in to the United bidding with an offer of $275 a share. Sara Albert, a 34-year-old Dallas law student, says she's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it. ""I have this feeling that it's built on sand,"" she says, that the market rises ""but there's no foundation to it."" She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash, although she still owns some Texaco stock. Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school, ""I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid."" Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand. ""We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot,"" said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg. ""We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime, come on back. Now it's happening again."" Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and, to his regret, never went back even as the market soared. This time he's ready to buy in ""when the panic wears off."" Still, he adds: ""We can't have this kind of thing happen very often. When the little guy gets frightened, the big guys hurt badly. Merrill Lynch can't survive without the little guy."" Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday, but mostly through mutual funds. Discount brokerage customers ""have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago,"" says Leslie Quick Jr., chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm. Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp., says Schwab customers ""have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks."" Individual investors are still angry about program trading, Mr. Quackenbush says. Avner Arbel, a Cornell University finance professor, says government regulators will have to more closely control program trading to ""win back the confidence of the small investor."" But it's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried. Alan Helfman, general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston, said he and his mother have some joint stock investments, but the overall economy is his chief worry. ""These high rollers took a big bath today,"" he said in his showroom, which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston's richest citizens. ""And I can tell you that a high roller isn't going to come in tomorrow and buy a Chrysler TC by Maserati."" And, finally, there were the gloaters. ""I got out in 1987. Everything,"" said Pascal Antori, an Akron, Ohio, plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments' LaSalle Street office. ""I just stopped by to see how much I would have lost."" Would Mr. Antori ever get back in? ""Are you kidding! When it comes to money: Once bitten, 2,000 times shy."""|Topic-Drift|topic-change|209

wsj_1148.out| Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month,|" say individuals familiar with the company's strategy. The size of the cuts isn't known, but they'll be centered in the exploration and production division, which is responsible for locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas. Employees haven't yet been notified. Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver. This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil, which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by 15% to 20% during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide shakeout. Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations. In yesterday's third-quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a $40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations. The report says that ""the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations."" A company spokesman, reached at his home last night, would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week. Most oil companies, including Mobil, have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings, largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses. Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output. Yesterday, Mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million loss in the third quarter, while comparable foreign operations earned $234 million. Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year. Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year. Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified. One Mobil executive said that the $40 million charge related to the action indicates ""a substantial"" number of people will be involved. Some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations."|means|manner-means|330

wsj_1146.out| The Polish rat will eat well this winter.|" Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. Many a piglet won't be born as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded. That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. ""Shortageflation,"" as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are. At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. Here, they are searching for a higher price. In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. ""Of course it's better to sell private,"" he says, as the butcher trundles away. ""Why should anybody want to sell to them?"" The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here. He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. ""There's no feed,"" he says. ""You can't buy anything nowadays. I don't know why."" Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled ""Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R."" The farmer at the next truck shouts, ""Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!"" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. ""Country people breed pigs,"" says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. ""They can't buy feed from the state. There isn't enough. Some state middlemen come to buy from me. I sell -- a little. I am waiting. I have plenty more at home."" On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. A private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business. The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away. State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, ""free"" prices or not, until something else replaces them. Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. ""We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,"" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. ""There are a lot of them, and they have property."" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. ""It's bad soil,"" he says. Until 1963, it was good soil. Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water. Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. Their protest was ignored. The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. He expected as much. In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. No phones. No gas. ""We wanted them to build a road here,"" he says. ""They started, and then abandoned it."" A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. ""It's Russian. Good for nothing. Parts are a tragedy. Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need."" The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%. The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. ""I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. ""We have one near here. There is a lot of waste. A private farmer never wastes anything."" The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire. He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices. ""I'm on my own land,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. ""I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do."" ""Sometimes,"" says his wife, ""we're happy about that."" By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland. Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. Farm income is 15% below the average. The young leave, especially girls who won't milk cows by hand. Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow. Without machines, good farms can't get bigger. So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million. Meat consumption is at 1979's level, pork production at 1973's, milk output at 1960's. If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity. The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth. Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken. Grain, milk and meat come next. A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast. Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale. Solidarity wants it from the West. Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: ""The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system."" Felix Siemienas is destroying it now. He packs pork. A law went on the books in January that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs. He cashed in. Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise. ""I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees,"" he says. He is in Warsaw to open a shop. ""I hire transportation, and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day. I don't subsidize anyone. Everyone around me lives well. Yes, my prices are high. If nobody buys, I bring my prices down. That's the rule. That's the market."" Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune -- $10,000 a month, he says. He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window. But the meat-processing machines he picked up are 50 years old. ""I don't want expensive machines. If the situation changes, I'll get stuck with them."" That's politics. By taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges, Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur. Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support. It objected again in September when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister. Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers. The Peasants can make a credible case, against Solidarity, that hell-bent reform will drive millions from the land. Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections. But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction -- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- will stay planted in the Polish countryside. ""We know how to get from capitalism to socialism,"" Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying one afternoon. ""We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism."" He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places. Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the ""naczelnik."" ""Many people in Poland hope this government will break down,"" says Mr. Niciporuk, who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity. ""That's what the naczelnik counts on. He is our most dangerous enemy. Every time he sees me, he gets very nervous."" The farmer barges into the naczelnik's office. A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper. Mr. Niciporuk sits. Anatol Pawlowski's leg begins jiggling beneath his desk. ""Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region,"" he says after a few pleasantries. ""They want to turn everything upside down in a week. Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used at the moment by a state farm. He can't guarantee that he can use it any better."" ""I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm."" The naczelnik averts his eyes. ""What have you got? Not even a tractor. And you want to make wicker baskets, too."" ""I can do five things at once -- to be a businessman."" ""Big business,"" Mr. Pawlowski snorts in English. The farmer stands to go. The naczelnik stands, too. ""I care very much for this post,"" he says. ""Eight years I've had it. A cultural center has been built, shops. Suddenly, I am not a comfortable man for Solidarity. I have accomplished too much. They want to do more. I wish them all the best!"" The farmer leaves. And the naczelnik shuts his door."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|447
wsj_1146.out| The Polish rat will eat well this winter.|" Tons of delectably rotting potatoes, barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state's buyers away. Many a piglet won't be born as a result, and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop. But with inflation raging, grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank. Once again, the indomitable peasant holds Poland's future in his hands. Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over. In coming months, emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the one buffer between a meat-hungry public and a new political calamity. Factory workers on strike knocked Poland's Communist bosses off balance last year; this year, it was the farmers who brought them down. In June, farmers held onto meat, milk and grain, waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises. The Communists froze prices instead. The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops. On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped. Without buffer stocks, inflation exploded. That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done. ""Shortageflation,"" as economists have come to call it, had gone hyper. The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one. The farmers stayed angry. They still are. At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell. Here, they are searching for a higher price. In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field, Andrzej Latowski wrestles a screeching, overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher's Polish Fiat. ""Of course it's better to sell private,"" he says, as the butcher trundles away. ""Why should anybody want to sell to them?"" The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here. He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up. ""There's no feed,"" he says. ""You can't buy anything nowadays. I don't know why."" Edward Chojnowski does. His truck is parked across the field, in a row of grain sellers. Like the others, it is loaded with rye, wheat and oats in sacks labeled ""Asbestos. Made in U.S.S.R."" The farmer at the next truck shouts, ""Wheat! It's nice! It won't be cheaper! We sell direct!"" A heavy, kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers, and counts him out a pile of zlotys. ""Country people breed pigs,"" says Mr. Chojnowski, leaning against the back of his truck. ""They can't buy feed from the state. There isn't enough. Some state middlemen come to buy from me. I sell -- a little. I am waiting. I have plenty more at home."" On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either. At closing time, farmers cart out most of what they carted in. A private market like this just isn't big enough to absorb all that business. The hulk of Stalinism, it seems, will not quickly crumble away. State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, ""free"" prices or not, until something else replaces them. Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. ""We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,"" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. ""There are a lot of them, and they have property."" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. ""It's bad soil,"" he says. Until 1963, it was good soil. Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water. Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. Their protest was ignored. The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. He expected as much. In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. No phones. No gas. ""We wanted them to build a road here,"" he says. ""They started, and then abandoned it."" A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. ""It's Russian. Good for nothing. Parts are a tragedy. Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need."" The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%. The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. ""I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. ""We have one near here. There is a lot of waste. A private farmer never wastes anything."" The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire. He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices. ""I'm on my own land,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. ""I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do."" ""Sometimes,"" says his wife, ""we're happy about that."" By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland. Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors. Farm income is 15% below the average. The young leave, especially girls who won't milk cows by hand. Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow. Without machines, good farms can't get bigger. So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million. Meat consumption is at 1979's level, pork production at 1973's, milk output at 1960's. If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity. The potential is displayed along every road into Warsaw: row upon row of greenhouses, stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners' wealth. Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken. Grain, milk and meat come next."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|448

Polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement, processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors, pesticides, fertilizers and feed. The Communists spent 40 years working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here. Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started. But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer. ""We are dealing with real entrepreneurs,"" says Antoni Leopold, an economist who advises Rural Solidarity, the union's countryside offshoot. ""There are a lot of them, and they have property."" Polish peasants, spurning the collectivizers, were once a source of shame to orthodox Communists. Now, among Communist reformers, they are objects of envy. Food is the reformer's top priority, the key to popular support. As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning, family farms thrive where collectives fail. Ownership, it seems, is the best fertilizer. The Poles have had it all along. Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land. On it, a quarter of the country's 39 million people produce three-quarters of its grain, beef, eggs and milk, and nine-tenths of its fruit, vegetables and potatoes. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Polish peasant is a pillar of the nation. Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him. And they did try. A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms. Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz owns 30 acres in 14 scattered scraps. He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens, five cows and 25 piglets. In patched pants and torn shoes, he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic. ""It's bad soil,"" he says. Until 1963, it was good soil. Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water. Farmers lay down before the bulldozers. Their protest was ignored. The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice. Mr Pyszkiewicz smiles and his brow furrows. He expected as much. In his lifetime, 47 years, the Communists brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir. No phones. No gas. ""We wanted them to build a road here,"" he says. ""They started, and then abandoned it."" A tractor, his only mechanized equipment, stands in front of the pigsty. ""It's Russian. Good for nothing. Parts are a tragedy. Even if I had a lot of money, I couldn't buy what I need."" The farmer can say the same for coal, cement, saw blades. In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%. The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made. They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed. Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork. ""I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun. ""We have one near here. There is a lot of waste. A private farmer never wastes anything."" The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago. But it never did let up on the pressure. Until recently, a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension. The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state. His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain. Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines. When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain. A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it. He is free to invest in chickens, and to fail for lack of chicken wire. He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices. ""I'm on my own land,"" Mr. Pyszkiewicz says. ""I don't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do."" ""Sometimes,"" says his wife, ""we're happy about that."""|problem-solution-n|topic-comment|525

wsj_1146.out| A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money|" than Poland can spare, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast. Poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale. Solidarity wants it from the West. Maria Stolzman, one of its farm experts, lays it on the line: ""The World Bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system."" Felix Siemienas is destroying it now. He packs pork. A law went on the books in January that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs. He cashed in. Poland is short on enterprises, not enterprise. ""I pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees,"" he says. He is in Warsaw to open a shop. ""I hire transportation, and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day. I don't subsidize anyone. Everyone around me lives well. Yes, my prices are high. If nobody buys, I bring my prices down. That's the rule. That's the market."" Mr. Siemienas is making a fortune -- $10,000 a month, he says. He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window. But the meat-processing machines he picked up are 50 years old. ""I don't want expensive machines. If the situation changes, I'll get stuck with them."" That's politics. By taking power in a deal with the Peasant Party's onetime Communist stooges, Solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur. Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support. It objected again in September when Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reluctantly named a Peasant Party man as his agriculture minister. Both the Peasants and Rural Solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers. The Peasants can make a credible case, against Solidarity, that hell-bent reform will drive millions from the land. Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections. But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction -- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- will stay planted in the Polish countryside. ""We know how to get from capitalism to socialism,"" Sergiusz Niciporuk is saying one afternoon. ""We don't know how to get from socialism to capitalism."" He farms 12 acres in Grabowiec, two miles from the Soviet border in one of Poland's poorest places. Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village, on a visit to the Communist administrator, the ""naczelnik."" ""Many people in Poland hope this government will break down,"" says Mr. Niciporuk, who belongs to the local council and to Rural Solidarity. ""That's what the naczelnik counts on. He is our most dangerous enemy. Every time he sees me, he gets very nervous."" The farmer barges into the naczelnik's office. A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper. Mr. Niciporuk sits. Anatol Pawlowski's leg begins jiggling beneath his desk. ""Solidarity doesn't care for the good of this region,"" he says after a few pleasantries. ""They want to turn everything upside down in a week. Mr. Niciporuk here wants 60 acres used at the moment by a state farm. He can't guarantee that he can use it any better."" ""I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm."" The naczelnik averts his eyes. ""What have you got? Not even a tractor. And you want to make wicker baskets, too."" ""I can do five things at once -- to be a businessman."" ""Big business,"" Mr. Pawlowski snorts in English. The farmer stands to go. The naczelnik stands, too. ""I care very much for this post,"" he says. ""Eight years I've had it. A cultural center has been built, shops. Suddenly, I am not a comfortable man for Solidarity. I have accomplished too much. They want to do more. I wish them all the best!"" The farmer leaves. And the naczelnik shuts his door."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|642

wsj_1306.out| Tandy Corp. said|" it won't join U.S. Memories, the group that seeks to battle the Japanese in the market for computer memory chips. Tandy's decision is a second setback for U.S. Memories. Last month, Apple Computer Inc. said that it wouldn't invest in the group. Apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development. U.S. Memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market dominated by the Japanese. Those chips were in dire shortage last year, hurting many U.S. computer companies that couldn't get sufficient Japanese-supplied chips. Tandy said its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor. ""At this time, we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need {for DRAMs} from the market as a rule,"" said Ed Juge, Tandy's director of market planning. Sanford Kane, U.S. Memories president, said the decision was ""disappointing,"" but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure. ""I would like to have had them,"" he said. But ""they weren't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it."" Mr. Kane became president and chief executive officer of U.S. Memories last June, when the group was formed by seven electronics companies: Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital Equipment Corp.; Hewlett-Packard Co.; Intel Corp.; International Business Machines Corp.; LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor Corp. Mr. Kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week. U.S. Memories needs a catalyst, he said, to inspire others to join. But so far, most potential participants haven't decided. Sun Microsystems Inc. said it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it was waiting to see U.S. Memories' business plan. Personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. said it is still studying the situation.

wsj_2354.out|" Call it the ""we're too broke"|" to fight"" defense. Lawyers for dozens of insolvent savings and loan associations are trying a new tack in their efforts to defuse suits filed by borrowers, developers and creditors. The thrifts' lawyers claim that the suits, numbering 700 to 1,000 in Texas alone, should be dismissed as moot because neither the S&Ls nor the extinct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has the money to pay judgments. Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it, even the S&L lawyers concede there's little precedent to back their position. Still, one federal appeals court has signaled it's willing to entertain the notion, and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in Texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law. The dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court dockets in Texas and reducing the FSLIC's massive legal bills, which topped $73 million last year. The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch, best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team. Sunbelt foreclosed on the ranch. Sunbelt and the FSLIC argued to the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ""that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against Sunbelt Savings nor any means to collect from any other party, including FSLIC."" ""If true,"" the court wrote, ""this contention would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds."" But the court said it lacked enough financial information about Sunbelt and the FSLIC and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas. Charles Haworth, a lawyer for Sunbelt, says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits, because Sunbelt's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $2 billion when federal regulators closed it in August 1988. ""This institution is just brain dead,"" says Mr. Haworth, a partner in the Dallas office of Andrews & Kurth, a Houston law firm. But a lawyer for Triland Investment Group, the developer of Valley Ranch, dismisses such arguments as a ""defense du jour."" Attorney Richard Jackson of Dallas says a judgment for Triland could be satisfied in ways other than a monetary award, including the reversal of Sunbelt's foreclosure on Valley Ranch. ""We're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory,"" he says.

wsj_0689.out| Wanted:|" An investment that's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about. With $150 billion of CDs maturing this month, a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment. In April, when many of them bought their CDs, six-month certificates were yielding more than 9%; investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts. Now, the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8%, and 8.5% is about the best around. But investors looking for alternatives aren't finding it easy. Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago. And the stock market's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there. ""If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD, you're not going to find it,"" says Washington financial planner Dennis M. Gurtz. There are, however, some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider, investment advisers say. Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return. In particular, advisers say, investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that CD holders are confronting right now, of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates. A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense. ""People should remember their money isn't all or nothing -- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it,"" says Bethesda, Md., adviser Karen Schaeffer. Here's a look at some of the alternatives: SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS: Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators. Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years. That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors. For an investor paying tax at a 33% rate, a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%. Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals. Some of the more cautious CD holders might like ""pre-refunded"" municipals. These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired. ""It's a no-brainer: You don't have to worry about diversification; you don't have to worry about quality,"" says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc. Consider a ""laddered"" bond portfolio, with issues maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994, advises Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly, R.I., financial planner. The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates. BOND FUNDS: Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell. That makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so. Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right. But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead. Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates. The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens. Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day. The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount. But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2-year average maturity. ""You get equity-like returns"" from bonds if you guess right on rates, says James E. Wilson, a Columbia, S.C., planner. If interest rates don't change, bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields. DEFERRED ANNUITIES: These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2. Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity. An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years, after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities. Some current rates exceed those on CDs. For instance, a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance, Chicago, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years. Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions. But at age 55, ""they may be a great deal,"" says Mr. Wilson, the Columbia, S.C., planner. MONEY MARKET FUNDS: That's right, money market mutual funds. The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present, when rates seem headed down. With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates, with a slight lag. Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall, says Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta. That's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield. Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield just under 9.5%. A new fund, its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor. Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates, suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co. If rates unexpectedly rise, the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund."|summary-n|summary|872

wsj_0689.out| SHORT-TERM MUNICIPALS:|" Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators. Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years. That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors. For an investor paying tax at a 33% rate, a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%. Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals. Some of the more cautious CD holders might like ""pre-refunded"" municipals. These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired. ""It's a no-brainer: You don't have to worry about diversification; you don't have to worry about quality,"" says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president of the New York bond firm of Gabriele, Hueglin & Cashman Inc. Consider a ""laddered"" bond portfolio, with issues maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994, advises Malcolm A. Makin, a Westerly, R.I., financial planner. The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates. BOND FUNDS: Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell. That makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so. Buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right. But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead. Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates. The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens. Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day. The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount. But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2-year average maturity. ""You get equity-like returns"" from bonds if you guess right on rates, says James E. Wilson, a Columbia, S.C., planner. If interest rates don't change, bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields. DEFERRED ANNUITIES: These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2. Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity. An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years, after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities. Some current rates exceed those on CDs. For instance, a CD-type annuity from North American Co. for Life & Health Insurance, Chicago, offers 8.8% interest for one year or a 9% rate for two years. Annuities are rarely a good idea at age 35 because of the withdrawal restrictions. But at age 55, ""they may be a great deal,"" says Mr. Wilson, the Columbia, S.C., planner. MONEY MARKET FUNDS: That's right, money market mutual funds. The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present, when rates seem headed down. With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates, with a slight lag.

With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates, with a slight lag. Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall, says Guy Witman, an editor of the Bond Market Advisor newsletter in Atlanta. That's because top-yielding funds currently offer yields almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the average CD yield. Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield just under 9.5%. A new fund, its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor. Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates, suggests Back Bay Advisors Inc., a mutual fund unit of New England Insurance Co.

wsj_1331.out| GAF, Part III is scheduled to begin today.|" After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably. The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations. In an eight-count indictment, the government charged GAF, a Wayne, N.J., chemical maker, and Mr. Sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of Union Carbide Corp. in advance of GAF's planned sale of a large block of the stock in 1986. The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian. The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian. Mr. Jefferies's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing. But GAF's bellwether role was short-lived. The first GAF trial ended in a mistrial after four weeks when U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe found that a prosecutor improperly, but unintentionally, withheld a document. After 93 hours of deliberation, the jurors in the second trial said they were hopelessly deadlocked, and another mistrial was declared on March 22. Meanwhile, a federal jury found Mr. Bilzerian guilty on securities fraud and other charges in June. A month later, Mr. Jefferies was spared a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government. In August, Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts. Nevertheless, the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the GAF case. The mistrials have left the reputations of GAF, Mr. Sherwin and GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman in limbo. For Mr. Sherwin, a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count. GAF faces potential fines of $500,000 for each count. Individuals familiar with the case said that throughout September, defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial, but by the end of the month the talks had ended. There is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of GAF's attorney, Arthur Liman, and Mr. Sherwin's counsel, Stephen Kaufman, will include testimony by Mr. Sherwin or Mr. Heyman. Neither testified at the previous trials. For now, defense attorneys are tight-lipped about their plans. Max Gitter, another GAF defense attorney, said yesterday, ""As we go in for the third time, Yogi Berra's famous line is apt: `It's deja vu all over again. '"" DALKON SHIELD CLAIMANTS hope to stop reorganization-plan appeal. Attorneys for more than 18,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co., which manufactured the device. The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other. Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan. The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims. It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co. The latter provision is ""legally unprecedented,"" said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C., who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants. More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending. The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries. Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts. American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins, but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted. In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week, Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising ""abstract"" and ""theoretical"" legal issues, while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants. The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6. JURY`S CRIMINAL CONVICTION under Superfund law is a first. Charles A. Donohoo, sole proprieter of a Louisville, Ky., demolition company, was found guilty of violating the Superfund law as well as the Clean Air Act. Criminal convictions under the federal Superfund law are rare, and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case. Under Superfund, those who owned, generated or transported hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup, regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time. Environmental lawyers say virtually all of the Superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past polluting activities. But Superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic substances into the environment. In 1986 Congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony. Mr. Donohoo was convicted in Louisville late last month of violating Superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was demolishing. He was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building, a violation of the Clean Air Act. The government sought a criminal penalty because ""no cleanup is possible here. Once {asbestos} is released into the environment, it can lodge anywhere,"" says Richard A. Dennis, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case. Mr. Donohoo is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 11. His lawyer could not be reached for comment. Mr. Donohoo faces as much as three years in prison and a $250,000 fine for the Superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $100,000 fine for the violation of the Clean Air Act. TED BUNDY'S LAWYERS switch to victims' side in death-sentence case. Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, the Washington, D.C., law firm that spent over $1 million fighting the execution of mass-murderer Ted Bundy -- who eventually was executed -- has taken on another death penalty case before the Supreme Court, this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in Arkansas. The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group. The key issue in the case, which the law firm is handling without a fee, or pro bono, is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review. The murderer, Ronald Gene Simmons, was convicted of killing 14 people. Another murderer on death row has appealed Mr. Simmons's death sentence in a ""next friend"" capacity. Wilmer Cutler's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the inmate who filed the appeal lacks proper standing. P.J. Mode, Wilmer Cutler's managing partner, says the trial team that represented Mr. Bundy was asked by the firm's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised. The coupling of the law firm and the Washington Legal Foundation is odd also, because Wilmer Cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for displaying a liberal bias in its pro bono work. ""We give them a lot of credit for taking this case,"" says WLF's Alan Slobodin. THE CASE OF THE FAKE DALIS: In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs. James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs. The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, although the government says they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece. Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million. Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali, who died in January. The posters were printed on paper pre-signed by Mr. Dali, the attorneys said."|Topic-Shift|topic-change|997

wsj_1331.out| Attorneys for more than 18,000 women|" who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for A.H. Robins Co., which manufactured the device. The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other. Baltimore attorney Michael A. Pretl and 17 other attorneys representing 18,136 claimants in the U.S. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay -- and perhaps even destroy -- a $2.38 billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan. The bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the Supreme Court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims. It also bars future suits against Robins company officials, members of the Robins family and Robins's former insurer, Aetna Life & Casualty Co. The latter provision is ""legally unprecedented,"" said Alan B. Morrison, a public interest lawyer in Washington, D.C., who is challenging the plan on behalf of 900 claimants. More than 100,000 claims against Robins are pending. The company made and marketed the Dalkon Shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries. Robins has been in proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since August 1985; such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts. American Home Products Corp. wants to acquire Robins, but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted. In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last week, Mr. Pretl criticizes the appeal for raising ""abstract"" and ""theoretical"" legal issues, while jeopardizing the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants. The Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the case Nov. 3 and may issue a decision as early as Nov. 6."|evaluation-s|evaluation|1036

The law firm has filed a friend-of-the-court brief jointly with the Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group.

wsj_1331.out| In federal court in Manhattan, three defendants pleaded guilty to charges of fraud in connection with the sale of fake Salvador Dali lithographs.| James Burke and Larry Evans, formerly owners of the now-defunct Barclay Gallery, and Prudence Clark, a Barclay sales representative, were charged with conducting high-pressure telephone sales in which they misrepresented cheap copies of Dali artwork as signed, limited-edition lithographs. The posters were sold for $1,300 to $6,000, although the government says they had a value of only $53 to $200 apiece. Henry Pitman, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, said about 1,000 customers were defrauded and that Barclay's total proceeds from the sales were $3.4 million. Attorneys for Messrs. Burke and Evans and Ms. Clarke said that although their clients admitted to making some misrepresentations in the sales, they had believed that the works were authorized by Mr. Dali, who died in January.

wsj_0655.out| Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do:|" revive a constituency for the Contra rebels. Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that ""if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees."" But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine said yesterday on NBC-TV's ""Meet the Press"" that Mr. Ortega's threat was ""a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it."" The threat came during a two-day celebration in Costa Rica to highlight Central America's progress toward democracy in the region, attended by President Bush, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 14 other Western Hemisphere leaders. Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night. Mr. Ortega announced on Friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic Contra assaults against his army. Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras. He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels. Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections. Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates. And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March. The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988. While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued. Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan. said yesterday on ""Meet the Press"": ""I would hope after his {Mr. Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid."" Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader. While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue. ""The administration should now state that if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid,"" said former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams. ""In these circumstances, I think they'd win."" Sen. Mitchell said that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections, although he added that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action. Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves. Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: ""I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers."" Mr. Baker's assistant for inter-American affairs, Bernard Aronson, while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: ""It's never very clear who starts what."" He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire. In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections. Administration officials traveling with President Bush in Costa Rica interpreted Mr. Ortega's wavering as a sign that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections. Mr. Abrams said that Mr. Ortega is seeking to demobilize the Contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections. ""My sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for clamping down on campaigning"" by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency, he said."|summary-n|summary|1259

Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli. ""I was having a drink in Sardi's, when all of a sudden I saw a woman's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks. I knew it was someone important, so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough, it was Liza. So I said, `Hello. ' And she said, `Hello. ' Can you imagine? Liza said hello to me."" Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse. ""They can't help talking about the big important people they know, even if they don't really know them,"" says Dr. Freudenberger. Beauregard Houston-Montgomery, a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980, is an inveterate name-dropper. ""I do it innately and pathologically, and while it may occasionally get me into trouble, it's also gotten me access to parties and society,"" he says. Name-dropping recently helped Mr. Houston-Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol. ""I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave, but he drops so many good names, we decided to let him stay,"" says Steven Greenberg, publisher of Fame. ""After all, Warhol was the ultimate namedropper, dropping five a day in his diaries. And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing."" Mr. Houston-Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes, publisher of Forbes magazine (""We've been in the columns together"" Mary Boone, a New York art dealer (""I think she knows me, but I'm not sure "" and Bridget Fonda, the actress (""She knows me, but we're not really the best of friends"" Mr. Revson, the gossip columnist, says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party. These droppers don't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps, Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher. ""They even drop semi-obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl, whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows,"" says Mr. Revson. ""It's the one-upsmanship of name-dropping that counts."" But name-dropping has other benefits, often civic. In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image, some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer. Take Cleveland. It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire, because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban-development grant. Some people call it ""The Mistake on the Lake"" -- Lake Erie, that is. ""It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top,"" says George Miller, executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign, a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city's strengths. Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman's family owned a sporting-goods store in Cleveland, that the late actress Margaret Hamilton, who played the bad witch in ""The Wizard Of Oz,"" once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope's father, a stonemason, once worked on a church next to Severence Hall, Cleveland's main concert hall. ""Power names like that don't hurt the city's reputation,"" Mr. Miller says. In Hollywood, an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous. ""Why we even just sold a three-bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real-estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there,"" says David Rambo, a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co., a Los Angeles real-estate agency. ""Most people can't even remember his name."" (It is John Hart. Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there. ""If Flynn hadn't lived there, the property might have been priced $1 million lower,"" says Mr. Rambo, noting that Flynn's house has been bulldozed, and only the swimming pool remains. Press agents and public-relations practitioners are notorious name-droppers. And some even do it with malice aforethought. Len Kessler, a financial publicist in New York, sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him. He says that when Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist with USA Today, hasn't returned his phone calls, he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump, Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis. He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions. ""But it does get him to return my calls, and it makes me feel better for the times he's given me the brushoff,"" Mr. Kessler says. There are, of course, obvious dangers to blatant, unsubstantiated name-dropping. Jeffry Thal, a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles, warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud. ""Get caught and you're dead in the water,"" says Mr. Thal. Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor, a client, ""hates being called `Liz. '. . . If directors or producers phone me and say they know `Liz, ' I know they've never met her. She prefers `Elizabeth. '""   In New York society, Pat Buckley, the very social wife of author William Buckley, has the nicknames ""Mrs. Buckles"" and ""Patsy."" And her husband sometimes calls her ""Ducky."" ""But call her `Patty, ' and it's a sure giveaway you're not in her circle, because she doesn't use that name,"" says Joan Kron, editor-in-chief of Avenue magazine, a monthly publication sent to all the right names. John Spencer Churchill, a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill, former prime minister of Great Britain, isn't that impressed with most name-droppers he meets. That's because they only drop ""mere names,"" says Mr. Churchill. Currently writing his memoirs, Mr. Churchill, an artist, tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty, the oil billionnaire, were, in fact, known only by one initial, their last. ""When you're at the club, you ask whether they've spoken to `G.' Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean. But no one else does. Now that's name-dropping, if you know what I mean."""|evaluation-s|evaluation|1357

wsj_0627.out| October employment data|" -- also could turn out to be the most confusing. On the surface, the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from September's 5.3%. But the actual head count of non-farm employment payroll jobs is likely to be muddied by the impact of Hurricane Hugo, strikes, and less-than-perfect seasonal adjustments, economists said. The consensus view calls for an overall job gain of 155,000 compared with September's 209,000 increase. But the important factory-jobs segment, which last month plunged by 103,000 positions and raised recession fears, is most likely to be skewed by the month's unusual events. Several other reports come before Friday's jobs data, including: the September leading indicators index, new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain-store sales on Thursday. Friday brings the final count on October auto sales. ""The employment report is going to be difficult to interpret,"" said Michael Englund, economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. Mr. Englund added that next month's data isn't likely to be much better, because it will be distorted by San Francisco's earthquake. What's more, he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past, because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data. Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below 50%, as it has for the past couple of months. A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above 50% indicates an economy that's expanding. Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc., Chicago, said that the purchasers' report is valuable because it often presents the first inkling of economic data for the month. But he added: ""Some people use the purchasers' index as a leading indicator, some use it as a coincident indicator. But the thing it's supposed to measure -- manufacturing strength -- it missed altogether last month."" David Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., Boston, said that the purchasers' index ""does miss occasionally,"" adding: ""When it misses one month it tends to miss the next month, too."" The consensus view on September leading indicators calls for a gain of 0.3%, the same as in August. Economists said greatly increased consumer optimism, a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index. All orders-related components, such as consumer-goods orders and building permits, are thought to have been weaker. Data Resources' Mr. Wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than ususal on October chain-store sales. Usually, October ""isn't a very interesting month {for retail figures} because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for December to buy Christmas presents,"" he said. But Mr. Wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an inkling of whether consumers' general buying habits may slack off as much as their auto-buying apparently has. He noted that higher gasoline prices will help buoy the October totals. Seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on September new-home sales, which are believed to have fallen sharply from August's 755,000 units. Construction spending is believed to have slipped about 0.5% from August levels, although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|1546

wsj_1189.out| Savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often|" as they reject whites, the Office of Thrift Supervision said. But that doesn't necessarily mean thrifts are discriminating against blacks, the agency said. The office, an arm of the Treasury, said it doesn't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus can't determine why blacks are rejected more often. Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill, where the information was released yesterday at a Senate banking subcommittee hearing, lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities. They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws. Sen. Alan Dixon (D, Ill. chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs, said, ""I'm not a statistician. But when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites -- and in some cities, it is three and four times as often -- I conclude that discrimination is part of the problem."" James Grohl, a spokesman for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said, ""The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread."" The trade group official added: ""Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it."" Sen. Dixon held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of discimination in mortgage lending. The legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race, sex and income level of borrowers, but that information won't be gathered in new studies for several months at least. The Federal Reserve said its studies in recent years, which adjust for income differences and other variables, showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites. But John LaWare, a Fed governor, told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the Fed's believes the vast majority of banks aren't discriminating. For instance, he noted, the Fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites. Several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination. ""We would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years"" to developing examinations for discrimination, said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Office of Thrift Supervision. ""If we've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly,"" said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich. chairman of the banking committee, ""then that is a matter that needs remedy now, not six months from now, or six years from now, or 26 years from now."" Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said they have punished only a few banks for violations of anti-discrimination laws. The FDIC said it has issued five citations to banks over the past three years for discriminatory practices. The comptroller's office said it found no indications of illegal discrimination in 3,437 examinations of banks since April 1987. The comptroller's office also said that of 37,000 complaints it received since January 1987, only 16 alleged racial discrimination in real estate lending. The agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited. Thrift regulators didn't give any figures on their enforcement actions. Mr. Fiechter said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of ""testers"" -- government investigators who would pose as home buyers. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has used testers to investigate discrimination in rental housing. Using testers could be controversial with financial institutions, but Mr. Grohl said the U.S. League of Savings Institutions hadn't yet taken any position on the matter."|Problem-Solution|topic-comment|1611

The restaurant operator cited transaction costs from its 1988 recapitalization as a result of a $160 million restructuring of its bank debt. The write-off will be reported as an extraordinary item in the company's 1989 operating results. In addition, the effective interest rate on the $410 million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is 10.66%. The combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $4 million in interest expenses next year, or six cents a share.

wsj_1142.out| The Nasdaq over-the-counter market didn't fully recover from a selling stampede,|" and closed down 1.2%. The effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among exchange-listed stocks irked many market makers, who watched the Nasdaq Composite Index tumble in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally. After plummeting 1.8% at one point during the day, the composite rebounded a little, but finished down 5.52, at 461.70. In contrast, the industrial average recovered almost completely from its skid and closed down 0.1%. The New York Stock Exchange Composite was 0.4% lower for the day. As usual, the over-the-counter market's biggest technology stocks were hardest hit. Microsoft, battered by profit taking in recent sessions, sank as much as 4; but it finished at 80 7/8, down 2 1/4 on volume of one million shares. MCI Communications, the most active issue, finished down 5/8 to 42 1/8. MCI traded as low as 41 3/8 during the session. Other active stocks included Jaguar, whose American depositary receipts added 1/8 to 11 1/4. Apple Computer improved 7/8 to 47 5/8; Intel slipped 1/4 to 33 1/4, and Valley National Corp. was up 1/8 to 15 1/8. ""The market started with several strikes against it,"" said Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of UAL Corp. continued to unravel, and reports that the junk-bond market is disintegrating. But the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market, Mr. DaPuzzo said. Even though the over-the-counter market usually doesn't fall by as much as listed stocks during program-selling blitzes, he said, ""when the market does recover, the damage is done and it leaves Nasdaq down more than the Big Board."" Mr. DaPuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors. While Shearson doesn't do computer-guided program trading for its own account, the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes, Mr. DaPuzzo acknowledged. The volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders, too. They don't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically. Market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur. That means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers abound they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will. In such an environment, a market maker can absorb huge losses. But the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to soak up the stocks that are for sale. The market makers say they aren't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly. The situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly, exacerbating the rise and fall in stock prices during program-dominated trading. Groused Robert Antolini, head of over-the-counter trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette: ""It's making it tough for traders to make money."" He said that when sell programs kick in, many traders believe that ""there's no sense in sticking your nose out because you're an instant loser."" Kinder-Care Learning Centers added 1/4 to 4 7/8 on 461,200 shares. Lodestar Group said it will make a $6-a-share offer for the remaining Kinder-Care Learning Center common stock if it acquires a majority of the company's shares in a pending rights offering by Kinder-Care Learning Center's parent, Kinder-Care Inc. Shares of KinderCare Inc. closed at 3 1/2, also up 1/4, on volume of 700,000. Ohio Casualty dropped 2 1/8 to 49 1/2. The company posted third-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, down from $1.26 a year earlier. The company estimated that losses from Hurricane Hugo reduced net income by 32 cents a share in the most recent quarter. The company said losses from the Oct. 17 earthquake in California haven't yet been determined, but that it provides earthquake coverage to about 1,400 properties in the stricken area. Any quake-related losses will be reported in the fourth quarter, the company said. North Atlantic Industries jumped 1 to 5 3/4. The electronics-instrume- nts maker is to be acquired by Asset Management Associates for $7.25 a share. LIN Broadcasting slid 1 3/8 to 108 3/4, despite reporting third-quarter net of 46 cents a share, up from 39 cents the previous year. The company said the latest quarter included about $3.4 million in special legal and financial advisory costs related to McCaw Cellular Communications' bid for the company and LIN's merger pact with BellSouth. McCaw was unchanged at 40. XL/Datacomp slid 2 1/4 to 16 1/2 amid continuing concerns about the company's contract negotiations with International Business Machines. IBM is reviewing its entire business-partners program, and XL/Datacomp confirmed earlier this month that it was in talks with the company about possible modifications to its current IBM-remarketer contract. Remarketers make modifications to IBM's computer hardware and resell the products. Omni Capital Group surged 1 3/4 to 16 1/4. The company said net rose to 38 cents a share in its fiscal-first quarter ended Sept. 30, from 35 cents a shares a year ago."|elaboration-general-specific|elaboration|1708

wsj_1365.out| The Justice Department has revised certain internal guidelines|" and clarified others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants. The most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid disrupting ""the normal business functions"" of companies charged under the racketeering law, a senior department official said. Another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors ""not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties"" in a case brought under the racketeering law, the official, David Runkel, said. The department distributed the revisions and clarifications to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of updating prosecutorial guidelines, Mr. Runkel said. The changes apply to prosecutions brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. Under that law, defendants who allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of a ""criminal enterprise"" may be charged with racketeering and forced to forfeit the proceeds of the enterprise. The RICO law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers. They argue that the rights of RICO defendants and third parties not named in RICO indictments have been unfairly damaged. The department's most significant clarification of existing RICO policy is a directive to prosecutors that they should seek to seize assets from defendants ""in proportion"" to the nature of the alleged offense, Mr. Runkel said. ""That means that if the offense deals with one part of the business, you don't attempt to seize the whole business; you attempt to seize assets related to the crime,"" he explained. In general, the thrust of the department's directive is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction, Mr. Runkel said."|purpose|enablement|1800

wsj_0616.out| As competition heats up in Spain's crowded bank market,|" Banco Exterior de Espana is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities. Under the direction of its new chairman, Francisco Luzon, Spain's seventh largest bank is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank's privatization. The state-owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94% stake in Banco Exterior. The government directly owns 51.4% and Factorex, a financial services company, holds 8.42%. The rest is listed on Spanish stock exchanges. Some analysts are concerned, however, that Banco Exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional export-related activities. Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services, they argue, will be difficult, particularly if market conditions turn sour. If that proves true, analysts say Banco Exterior could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after 1992, when the European Community plans to dismantle financial barriers. With 700 branches in Spain and 12 banking subsidiaries, five branches and 12 representative offices abroad, the Banco Exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor. Mr. Luzon and his team, however, say they aren't interested in a merger. Instead, they are working to transform Banco Exterior into an efficient bank by the end of 1992. ""I want this to be a model of the way a public-owned company should be run,"" Mr. Luzon says. Banco Exterior was created in 1929 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports. The market for export financing was liberalized in the mid-1980s, however, forcing the bank to face competition. At the same time, many of Spain's traditional export markets in Latin America and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth. As a result, the volume of Banco Exterior's export credit portfolio plunged from 824 billion pesatas ($7.04 billion as of Dec. 31, 1986, to its current 522 billion pesetas. The other two main pillars of Banco Exterior's traditional business -- wholesale banking and foreign currency trading -- also began to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs. The bank was hamstrung in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government, analysts say. Until Mr. Luzon took the helm last November, Banco Exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes. But Mr. Luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy, cut costs, increase capital and build up new areas of business. ""We've got a lot to do,"" he acknowledged. ""We've got to move quickly."" In Mr. Luzon's first year, the bank eliminated 800 jobs. Now it says it'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years. The bank employs 8,000 people in Spain and 2,000 abroad. To strengthen its capital base, Banco Exterior this year issued $105 million in subordinated debt, launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors. The bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches. Last year's drop in export credit was partially offset by a 15% surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies. Though Spain has an excess of banks, analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in Europe, which will aid Banco Exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead. Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets. The bank says it's interested in purchasing banks in Morocco, Portugal and Puerto Rico. But the bank's retail activities in Latin America are likely to be cut back. Banco Exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four Spanish stock exchanges underwent sweeping changes in July. The late start may be a handicap for the bank as Spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition. But Mr. Luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, where he was formerly director general, will whip the bank's capital market division into shape by the end of 1992. The bank also says it'll use its international network to channel investment from London, Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris into the Spanish stock exchanges."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|1843

wsj_1387.out| Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.|" But this time it's hurting opposition as well as ruling-party members. And as it unfolds, it's revealing some of the more tangled and seamier aspects of Japanese society. Already, ruling Liberal Democratic Party demands that opposition members testify under oath in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month. But the scandal itself is so convoluted that ruling-party members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of undermining the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone. ""The opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the LDP is that kind of beast,"" says Shigezo Hayasaka, former aide to LDP kingmaker Kakuei Tanaka and now an independent analyst. But, he adds, ""We can't tell where it will go at all because we're still in the middle of it."" This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry. Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling. The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year. But the implications could be great. Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders. Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe. Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan. To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory. Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country. Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts. At 500 yen ($3.60 for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II. But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen (almost $92 billion or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry. And because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion, some observers estimate the real income could be as much as 20 trillion yen. If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen. In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions. Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament. The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral. In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report. And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue. But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money. Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations. So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes. Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000 and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen. On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175 by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal. Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations. They say its possible some of their members may be donating privately. The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese. That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society. Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way many Japanese do, to win favor or support. Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad. But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally."|elaboration-additional|elaboration|1974

So far, though, there have been no allegations that the contributions the LDP members received amounted to bribes. Then the two camps upped the ante: Reports that Chosen Soren had donated directly to JSP members were rapidly countered by statements that the South Korean residents' organization had long been donating directly to LDP members. The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000 and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen. On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175 by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. No one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal. Direct donations from either of the residents' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign, but both groups deny making direct donations. They say its possible some of their members may be donating privately. The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese. That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society. Many Japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would donate to politicians, the way many Japanese do, to win favor or support. Both residents' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad. But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally.|Sequence|temporal|2038
wsj_1387.out| In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported| that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members. The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren. The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.|Statement-Response|topic-comment|2039
